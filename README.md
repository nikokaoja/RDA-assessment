# RDA-assessment
This repository will host the assessment of Research Data Alliance.


## Initial RDA survey

In 2018 survey of RDA IGs and WGs was made for:
- [RDA DK Node](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_8wjX-l27Ytw5C7-1o5w9khQHvQlPqGIqkLXUraXZYE/edit?usp=sharing)  (in collaboration with the RDA DK co-chairs)
- [Wind Energy domain](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SHsdSEKl8cZQWKYJbMiGfsIJx0YYl6Tn4b7y_56TA1Q/edit?usp=sharing) (in collaboration with Anna Maria Sempreviva and Pawel Gancarski)
- [Engineering domains](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yg7n5Brqd9ZmuA-3lAxn1d0Ql0mpcHLbi0QHgvmaii4/edit?usp=sharing) (with feedbacks from Paula Lavanchy, co-chair of IG RDM in Engineering)

The above survey results have been presented for:
- [RDA DK node](https://zenodo.org/record/3247292#.XSMmuy2Q1Bw)
- [Wind energy domain](https://zenodo.org/record/3247020)
- [Engineering domains](https://zenodo.org/record/3246264)
